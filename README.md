# ParticleToy
This Application is just a fun little thing to play around with.
It basicaly displays a bunch of particles and lets you play around with them.

You can hold Ctrl and use mouse clicks to create ancor points.
The particles will interact with those points.
They will also change their behaviour depending on the number of ancors.

This is Version 3. I startet Version 1 during my school time but lost it becaus
the usb stick I had all my school projects on broke :D yeay that was fun.
I tryed recreating it (Version 2) but I was frustrated so I never really finished it.
But not I was fiddeling around and reprogrammed it to remember the good
old times :) So here you go with my Version 3 have fun.

This Application was inspiered by an iOS App named TeslaToy.
